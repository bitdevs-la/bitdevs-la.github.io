### Details

Join us for another amazing Bitcoin meetup!

This month we are excited to host [Richard Myers] who will be presenting on PeerSwap!

Richard is a long-time software developer who made the transition to Bitcoin and Lightning development thanks to [Chaincode Labs] summer residency program where he worked on tests for BIP-118 and the eltoo upgrade of Lightning. Richard is currently implementing the [PeerSwap] protocol for [ACINQ]'s Eclair Lightning node software.

[PeerSwap] enables Lightning Network nodes to balance their channels by facilitating atomic swaps with direct peers. PeerSwap enhances decentralization of the Lightning Network by enabling all nodes to be their own swap provider. No centralized coordinator, no 3rd party rent collector, and lowest cost channel balancing means small nodes can better compete with large nodes.
