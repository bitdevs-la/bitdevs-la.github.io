### Details  

Hey ya'll! Thanks for coming to our last meetup and making it a huge success. We're going to keep the party going with a Bitcoin pool party!

This time it'll be BYOB (Bring Your Own Beer). But we'll have our very own [DJ Gorilla Solz](https://soundcloud.com/gorillasolz) mixing it up poolside.

So bring your swimming trunks, your fun-selves, and maybe some hardware wallets to "lose" in a terrible pool accident. (This is a joke. Please don't bring your hardware wallets).

Also don't by shy about bringing some food/snacks too.

As a final note, we will be moving back to our regular Socratic Seminar style meetups in September.

See you there!

#### Location

The address listed in the event is NOT WHERE THE POOL PARTY WILL BE!

Iâ€™ll message everyone the address a couple of days before the event. You MUST rsvp to get the location but it will be somewhere in Venice.
