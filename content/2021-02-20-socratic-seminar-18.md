### Details  

Join us for another Socratic Seminar via Google Hangouts! This month we have the honor of hosting
[Alexis Sellier] to discuss [Nakamoto]: A new Bitcoin light-client written in Rust.

Alexis develops software that enhances individual user freedom. Most of his time is dedicated to
[Radicle], a peer-to-peer code collaboration stack, and Bitcoin, a decentralized payment network and
new kind of money.

He's been writing software for the last 17 years and have worked on almost all areas of the software
stack, though his interest lies with distributed systems and peer-to-peer technology.
