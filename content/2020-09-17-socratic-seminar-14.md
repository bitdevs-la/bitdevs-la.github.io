### Details  

Join us for another Socratic Seminar via Google Hangouts! This month we are joined by Satotious who 
will be speaking on "Funding the web with Lightning Network." They are a Lightning company that 
provides a new way of monetizing online content by giving users the choice between ads or 
micropayments. They hope to create a circular economy of online payments running on the Lightning 
Network which will generate more mainstream and widespread use of Bitcoin whilst ensuring maximum 
user and creator privacy.

CEO Ruby studied Journalism and Drama and is interested in decentralization and preserving the free 
web. CTO Christophe studied Computer Science and has experience working in blockchain tech.
