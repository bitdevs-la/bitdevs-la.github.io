### Socratic Seminar
Inspired by Bitdevs NY, this is an event for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. The Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing, and lively discussion.

Discussion topics from a variety of sources are collated by meetup members in the weeks preceding the events. We investigate pull requests in the Bitcoin Core, lnd, and other relevant repositories; we study network statistics, research papers, technical blog posts and other interesting content. To complete the meeting, members present open source projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&A section follow.

Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at the Socratic event or have a recommended topic for discussion: contact at bitdevsla.org

A post will be made prior to the event which outlines discussion topics. Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.

#### Bitcoin PRs
- [Show own outputs on PSBT signing window](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/740)
- [p2p: Restrict self-advertisements with privacy networks to avoid fingerprinting](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27411) prevents a node from advertising its Tor or I2P address to peers on other networks (such as plain IPv4 or IPv6) and wonâ€™t advertise its address from non-anonymity networks to peers on Tor and I2P. This helps prevent someone from associating a nodeâ€™s regular network address to one of its addresses on an anonymity network. CJDNS is treated differently from Tor and I2P at the moment, although that may change in the future.

#### Lightning PRâ€™s

- [LDK v.0.0.116](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.116)-It includes support for anchor outputs and multipath payments with keysend.
