### Details

Join us for another amazing Bitcoin meetup this coming Sunday! We're going to have free pizza and
beer right when the doors open so make sure to get there early in order to network with other local
Bitcoiners.

This month we have the pleasure of hosting Steve Lee, Lead at [Spiral](https://spiral.xyz/), who
will be sharing what they're building at Spiral and also briefly touching on the Bitcoin Design
Community. Spiral (formerly known as Square Crypto) is an offshoot
of [Square](https://squareup.com/) whose focus is to make bitcoin more than an investment. Some of
the projects they are developing include [Bitcoin Dev Ket](https://bitcoindevkit.org), 
[Lightning Dev Kit](https://lightningdevkit.org), and the 
[Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design/).

The talk will then be followed by a Socratic Seminar and then we will get drinks at a local
restaurant after.
