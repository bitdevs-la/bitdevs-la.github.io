### Details

Join us for another amazing Bitcoin meetup! We're going to have free pizza and
beer right when the doors open so make sure to get there early in order to network with other local
Bitcoiners.


This month we have the pleasure of hosting Steve Myers. Steve is a local bitcoiner and former, 
long-time enterprise Java developer. Two years ago, with a grant from Square Crypto (now Spiral) 
he became a full time bitcoin open source contributor, working primarily on the [Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)](https://bitcoindevkit.org) project. 
Steve will give an update on what's new for BDK and what he's focusing on this year for his BDK work.


The talk will then be followed by a Socratic Seminar and then we will get drinks at a local
restaurant after.
